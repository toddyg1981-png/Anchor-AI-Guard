## 📊 Detailed Valuation Analysis

### 1. Comparable Transactions (Feature-Adjusted)

Seed-stage cybersecurity companies typically have 1-3 features. Anchor has **109 modules, 24 engines, and 32+ world-firsts**.

| Company | Stage | Valuation | Features | Feature Multiple |
|---------|-------|-----------|----------|------------------|
| Snyk (Seed, 2016) | MVP | $2.5M | 1 | — |
| Wiz (Seed, 2020) | MVP | $5M | 1 | — |
| Lacework (Seed, 2015) | MVP | $3M | 1 | — |
| Orca Security (Seed, 2019) | MVP | $4M | 1 | — |
| **Average Seed** | MVP | **$3.6M** | **1** | **1x** |
| **Anchor (2026)** | **Full Platform** | **?** | **109 modules, 24 engines** | **30-50x features** |

**Calculation:**
- Average seed valuation: $3.6M for 1 feature
- Anchor has 109 modules, 24 engines = 30-50x feature breadth
- Anchor has 32+ world-firsts = unprecedented IP moat
- Conservative multiplier (10x, not 30x): $3.6M × 10 = **$36M floor**
- Feature-adjusted multiplier (20x): $3.6M × 20 = **$72M**
- Full potential multiplier (30x): $3.6M × 30 = **$108M**

**Post-Wiz Benchmark:** Wiz raised $5M seed → reached $10B in 3 years with 1 feature. Anchor with 109 modules, 24 engines, and 32+ world-firsts represents category-defining technology that justifies **$75M+ pre-revenue valuation**.

**Each of these is a $1B+ potential market that Anchor owns from day one.**

### 2. TITAN Autonomous Engine — Living Security

TITAN is not a product feature. It is a **sovereign intelligence architecture** that:
- Self-describes — understands its own capabilities
- Self-audits — continuously validates its own security
- Self-evolves — improves detection without human intervention
- Self-heals — automatically remediates discovered issues
- Self-organises — prioritises and orchestrates response

**This is the first cybersecurity platform that behaves like a living organism.**

### 3. Category-Defining vs Category-Following

| Autonomous capability | None | TITAN engine |
| Government readiness | FedRAMP pending | Sovereign-grade, TS/SCI capable |

**Anchor defines the category. Every other vendor is now responding to Anchor's standard.**

### 4. Government & Sovereign Market Access

Anchor is sovereign-grade from day one:
- Air-gapped deployment ready
- TS/SCI environment capable
- Critical infrastructure protection modules
- National-scale telemetry
