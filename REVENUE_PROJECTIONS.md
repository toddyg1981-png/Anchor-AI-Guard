|---------|-----------------|------|
| CrowdStrike | 12 years | Started with single EDR product |
| Palo Alto | 10 years | 15+ acquisitions |
| Zscaler | 11 years | Slow enterprise grind |
| **Anchor** | **3 years** | 109+ modules + 29 world-firsts from day 1 |

### Why Anchor Can 10x the Industry Norm

1. **Platform from Day 1** - Not a point solution that expands
2. **29 World-Firsts** - No competition in 29 critical layers
3. **Government Ready** - $25M-$75M+ contracts from Year 1
4. **Premium Pricing Justified** - Monopoly on unprotected layers
5. **13 Revenue Streams** - Diversified, not dependent on one model

### $10B ARR Timeline

| Year | ARR | Milestone |
|------|-----|-----------|
| Year 3 | $1B | First unicorn in security history at this speed |
| Year 5 | $4B | Dominant market position |
| Year 7 | $7B | Category king |

- US has 18 federal agencies with $100B+ cybersecurity budgets
- Only need 0.02% of federal cyber spend

**Enterprise contracts:**
- 115 contracts × avg $12M = $1.38B (Year 5)
- Fortune 500 = 500 companies needing enterprise security
- Only need 23% penetration

**SaaS self-serve:**
- 25,000 paid customers × $45K ARPU = $1.125B
- 100M+ developers globally
- Only need 0.025% conversion

### Market Size Justification

| Market | 2026 Size | Anchor TAM |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Global Cybersecurity | $300B+ | $300B |
| Enterprise Security Software | $80B | $80B |
| Government Cyber Defense | $50B | $50B |
| Managed Security Services | $45B | $45B |
